- [x] ~~Implement partial failure recovery (resume functionality)~~ (Skipped - Over-engineering, TD API doesn't support native resume)
- [x] **Add pyright for comprehensive type checking** (Completed - 0 errors, full type safety with strategic type: ignore for untyped imports)

### ~~Phase 3: Additional User Experience Improvements~~ (Future - Cancelled: Too complex)

### Post-Milestone 2: Future Considerations

**Note**: The following features were considered for Milestone 3 but **decided against** to maintain focus:

- Interactive confirmation prompts (over-engineering for CLI tool)
- Table filtering options (not requested by users)  
- Column-level copying (adds complexity without clear benefit)
- Bandwidth throttling (rare use case)
- Resume functionality (TD API doesn't support native resume)

**Decision**: Focus on documentation and user adoption rather than additional features.
